📈 Superstore Sales Dashboard Project
This repository contains the Tableau Dashboard and analysis for the Superstore Sales dataset, focusing on profitability and performance.

🚀 Dashboard Objectives & Key Metrics

The dashboard is designed to answer three critical business questions:

1.  How is the Business Trending? (Time Series Analysis)
2.  What Products Drive Profit or Loss? (Product Portfolio Review)
3.  Where are Our Best and Worst Markets? (Geographic Performance)

📈 Key Findings & Insights

Based on the preliminary analysis, the following critical insights were identified:

1.  Strong Seasonality: Sales and Profit consistently peak during the last quarter (Q4), indicating a high reliance on holiday/year-end purchasing.
2.  Profitability Crisis in Furniture: High-sales volume categories like Chairs and Tables show consistently negative Profit Ratios. This suggests a need for an urgent review of pricing, logistics, or discount policies for the Furniture category.
3.  Core Performers: Phones and Copiers are the most efficient product sub-categories, delivering high sales volume with excellent profit margins.
